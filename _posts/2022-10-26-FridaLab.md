FridaLab is an app to study the framework called Frida.
Before I knew this app, I kept coming to Crackme's Android, but it was difficult because I couldn't understand exactly how to use the API that Frida pursues.
My primary purpose of writing this article is to summarize why Frida was used this way.<br>
Let's get started ~

## ‚òùüèª FridaLab01

#### Change class challenge_01's variable 'chall01' to 1:

```java
    package uk.rossmarks.fridalab;

    /* loaded from: classes.dex */
    public class challenge_01 {
        static int chall01;

    public static int getChall01Int() {
        return chall01;
        }
    }
```

<br>

The first problem is to access the chall01 variable in challenge_01 class and change the value to 1.<br>
There are three things to think about to solve this problem.

> 1. How to access the challenge_01 class
>    <br>
> 2. How to approach the challenge_01 variable in the class
>    <br>
> 3. How to approach a variable and put it into the cycle (change)

<br>Let's work it out step by step<br>

### How to access a class

There are two ways to access a particular method through the class.<br>
First, use `Java.use(className)` API.<br>
The second is to use the `Java.choose(className,callback)` API.<br>

[ Please refer to the other blog for each description ] -> [blog](https://changkr28.tistory.com/entry/Frida-%EB%AC%B8%EB%B2%95)

### To access the method

The approach to the method is the same as in any other programming languages. `.` You can access the class' methods using the .

### To access a variable

Use the 'value' field to get the value.

## ‚úåüèª Code

```javascript
function sol1() {
  console.log("[>] Start");
  //     Java.perform APIÎ•º Ïù¥Ïö©ÌïòÏó¨ Í∞ÄÏÉÅÎ®∏Ïã†Í≥º Ïó∞Í≤∞ÎêòÏñ¥ÏûáÎäîÏßÄ ÌôïÏù∏

  Java.perform(function () {
    // ÌõÑÌÇπÌïòÍ≥†Ïûê ÌïòÎäî Î≥ÄÏàòÍ∞Ä staticÏúºÎ°ú ÏÑ†Ïñ∏ÎêòÏñ¥ ÏûàÍ∏∞ ÎïåÎ¨∏Ïóê use
    var className = Java.use("uk.rossmarks.fridalab.challenge_01");

    // Í∞í Ï†ëÍ∑ºÏùÑ ÏúÑÌï¥ value ÏÇ¨Ïö©
    className.chall01.value = 1;

    console.log("[>] Ï†ÄÏû•Îêú Í∞í: " + className.chall01.value);
  });
}

sol1();
```
