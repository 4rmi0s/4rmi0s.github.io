FridaLab is an app to study the framework called Frida.
Before I knew this app, I kept coming to Crackme's Android, but it was difficult because I couldn't understand exactly how to use the API that Frida pursues.
My primary purpose of writing this article is to summarize why Frida was used this way.
Let's get started ~

## ‚òùüèª FridaLab01
#### Change class challenge_01's variable 'chall01' to 1:
<br></br>
```java
package uk.rossmarks.fridalab;

/* loaded from: classes.dex */
public class challenge_01 {
    static int chall01;

public static int getChall01Int() {
    return chall01;
    }
    }
```
